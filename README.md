# Basic Follower Plugin for ExileAPI

## Setup
Download github content. Plugin folder structure should be ExileAPI/Plugins/Source/Follower with all of the files in this github located in that folder.
Open the plugin on your follower, set follower name, match up movement hotkeys and start it. 

## Usage
This will follow a target character, pick up quest items, grab waypoints, etc. You'll still need to talk to NPCs to claim rewards but it makes multi characters running through acts much more seamless.
